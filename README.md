# Irrigation
Rpi controlled irrigation

This is a Tkinter GUI that allows user to choose which solenoids are opened/closed when watering.
the GUI is programmed for 0.25 gallon metering and waters up to 3 gallons each solenoid.
very easy to use push button command and dropbox watering amount options.
also programmed a 'drain' button to pump all water from drum through the purge solenoid.
The watering options can be changed easily in the code as well as how many solenoids. (add/removed)
